# Protection settings optimizer 

The Protection settings optimizer (PSO) is a Python package for calculating optimal protection settings for power systems protection devices such as relays and reclosers. The PSO algorithm uses supplied network data and fault analysis to generate settings with minimal operating times while maintaining coordination between protection devices. The network data is used to identify protection device coordination pairs using graph theory-based path tracing. The fault analysis provides the fault currents observed at each protection device. The fault currents and the coordination pairs are used to formulate the relay settings as a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP). The MINLP is solved using a genetic algorithm-based solver. The figure below provides an overview of the protection settings optimizer process.

The section must contain an entry for each protection device for each time step.
Each device entry must contain the following:
 1. voltage (kV) : Voltage magnitude
 2. phi (deg) : Voltage angle
 3. real power flow (kW) 
 4. reactive power flow (kVar)

```
</details>

## Fault Data
The protection settings optimizer requires fault analysis data to calculate the protection settings. Similarly to the system information and steady-state data, one of three methods can be used to import fault data.
<details>
<summary> 1) Import from CSV</summary>
A ".CSV" file containing the following information for each fault at each protection device can be used to import the fault data.

 1. Fault Loaction (Fault bus)

</details>
<details>
<summary> 2) Simulate and Import from OpenDSS</summary>
The fault analysis information can be obtained from OpenDSS directly using the COM interface using the code below. The code simulates the necessary faults in OpenDSS and collects the fault currents observed by each device in the system for each fault.

```
Buses = SysInfo['Buses']

# %% collect fault Data 
faultBuses = [x['Name'] for x in Buses]
faultBusPhases = [None]*len(faultBuses)
for ii in range(len(faultBuses)):
    faultBusPhases[ii] = Buses[RSO_pack.index_dict(Buses,'Name',faultBuses[ii])]['nodes']

Fres = ['0.001','1']
Fts = ['3ph','SLG','LL']

FData = RSO_pack.getFaultInfo(dssCircuit,dssText,faultBuses,faultBusPhases,Fres,Fts,devLines,devNames,dev_BusV)
Fault_File_loc = pwd+'FData.csv'
FData.to_csv(Fault_File_loc,index=False,header=False)
Fault_Data_CSV = RSO_pack.read_Fault_CSV_Data(Fault_File_loc)
```
</details>
<details>
<summary> 3) Import from RONM</summary>
The fault information for each timestep should be included in the RONM output under the "Fault currents" section. 
The section must contain an entry for each fault and the voltages and currents observed by each device for the faults.
Each device entry must contain the following:
 1. |V| (V) : Voltage magnitude
 2. phi (deg) : Voltage angle
 3. |I| (A) : Current magnitude  
 4. theta (def): Voltage angle
 5. |I0| (A) : Zero sequence current
 6. |I1| (A) : Positive sequence current
 7. |I2| (A) : Negative sequence current

The following code can be used to read the fault analysis data from the RONM output.
```
# collect Fault Data
    faultBuses = list(jsonDict['Fault currents'][1].keys())
    faultBusesLOC = faultBuses
    faultBusPhases = [None]*len(faultBuses)
    for ii in range(len(faultBuses)):
        faultBusPhases[ii] = Buses[RSO_pack.index_dict(Buses,'Name',faultBuses[ii])]['nodes']

Fault_Data_CSV = RSO_pack.getRONMFaultData(Ts, faultBuses, devTypes, devNames, devLines, dev_BusV, jsonDict['Fault currents'][Ts])
```
</details>

```

## Examples 

### Cape/".CSV" Example
The Protection settings optimizer can be used with CAPE. PSS CAPE can be used to output device information and fault analysis needed by PSO as "CSV" files. The device status information file must contain a list of devices with their steady-state voltages, currents, and breaker status. An example file named "outputV1_624.csv" is provided, showing the data format required. An example fault data file named "fault_report_624.csv," which contains the fault analysis, is also provided as part of the example. A system information file containing the system configuration, layout, Bus information, Line information, transformer information, protection device information, and generation resource information is required. An example system information file named "IEEE123_Sysinfo.json" containing information for the IEEE 123 system is provided as part of the example. To run the setting optimizer using the data obtained from PSS@CAPE run the "CAPE_Example.py"

### OpenDSS Example
The Protection settings optimizer contains the code required to connect to OpenDSS and retrieve all necessary information to calculate relay settings. PSO utilizes the OpenDSS COM interface to obtain the required system information. PSO can also use a compiled and solved case to obtain the necessary device information and perform the fault analysis. An example integration with OpenDSS is provided in "Opendss_Example.py." This example will start OpenDSS compile the IEEE34bus system, solve the power flow and perform fault analysis to collect required device information for the optimization process.

### RONM Example

Resilient Operation of Networked Microgrids (RONM) uses "PowerModelsONM," an optimization library for operating and restoring electric power distribution feeders featuring networked microgrids. PowerModelsONM can be configured to output the necessary information to run the PSO. The outputs from the PowerModelsONM can be configured to output the system information, device information, and fault studies. The outputs are read by the PSO and used to calculate relay settings for each state the grid transitions through over the entire timeframe in the RONM output. An example integration with RONM output can be run using the "RONM_Example.py."
